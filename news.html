    <h1 class="nation">“Breaking News from Paradis: The Walls Have Fallen — and Peace May Finally Begin”</h1>
    <h2 class="nation">By the Paradis Daily Correspondent — Year 857</h2>
    <img src="titan.webp" width="800px">
    <p class="nation">After decades of bloodshed, the remnants of both Marleyan and Eldian forces have signed the Treaty
        of Fort Salta, marking the official end of humanity’s most destructive conflict.
        Commander Armin Arlert, now recognized as the mediator between nations, confirmed that the last of the Titans
        has been neutralized. “There are no more monsters,” Armin said during a press conference held near the ruins of
        Wall Maria. “Only people — and the choices they make.” <br>

        Survivors Rebuild <br>

        Former Survey Corps members have scattered across Paradis to aid in reconstruction. Mikasa Ackerman, who lives
        quietly near the forest once patrolled by Eren Jaeger, was seen helping children plant trees where Titans once
        stood. Sources close to her say she still visits Eren’s grave daily, bringing red scarves as offerings. <br>

        The Outside World Responds <br>

        In a historic broadcast, representatives from the continent pledged to lift the blockade on Paradis Island. Yet
        reports from the mainland suggest not everyone supports reconciliation. A radical faction calling itself The New
        Jaegerists is rumored to be forming — claiming Eren’s “will for freedom” must not be forgotten. <br>

        A Glimpse of Hope <br>

        Historians believe this marks the true beginning of the “Age Without Titans.” Though the shadow of the past
        still lingers, for the first time in over a century, humanity’s skies are free.</p> <br>

    <h1 class="sports">Breaking Sports News: Isagi Yoichi Crowned World’s Best Striker After Neo Egoist League Triumph!
    </h1>
    <h2 class="sports">By Japan Sports Network – Year 2032</h2>
    <img src="blue.jpg" width="800px">
    <p class="sports">In a stunning finale to the Neo Egoist League World Tournament, Japan’s Blue Lock striker Isagi
        Yoichi delivered the decisive goal against Brazil, leading Japan to its first-ever World Cup championship.

        The final whistle in Doha marked not just a victory for Japan, but for the controversial Blue Lock Project, once
        condemned for its extreme methods and “ego-driven” philosophy.

        The Rise of an Egoist <br>

        Isagi, now dubbed “The Blue Flame”, credited his success to the competitive crucible that was Blue Lock. “Ego
        isn’t selfishness,” he told reporters after lifting the trophy. “It’s believing your dream deserves to exist.”<br>

        Former rivals Nagi Seishiro and Bachira Meguru were seen embracing Isagi after the match — a moment social media
        dubbed “The Reunion of Egoists.”<br>

        From Controversy to Glory <br>

        Coach Jinpachi Ego made a rare public appearance, saying only, “This is proof that ego creates evolution.”
        Meanwhile, traditional football academies across the globe are reportedly creating their own “Ego Programs,”
        sparking debates in FIFA about the ethics of “individualistic training.” <br>

        A New Era of Football <br>

        As fireworks illuminated Tokyo’s skyline, sports analysts agreed on one thing — the Blue Lock generation has
        reshaped world football forever. <br>

        Rumors suggest a new project, codenamed “Blue Lock: Genesis,” will begin next spring — aimed not at strikers,
        but goalkeepers who can rival gods.</p> <br>

    <h1 class="entertiment">Entertainment Highlight: “The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity” Blossoms Into This
        Summer’s Must‑Watch</h1>
    <h2 class="entertiment">By Anime Culture Desk – July 2025</h2>
    <img src="love.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="entertiment">What makes it stand out

        The story centres on Rintarō Tsumugi, a kind‑hearted but intimidating‑looking student at rough‑and‑tumble
        Chidori High, and Kaoruko Waguri, a polite, privileged student from the nearby elite Kikyo Girls’ High. Their
        worlds collide when Kaoruko visits Rintarō’s family cake shop.
        The Times of India
        +1 <br>

        Animated by CloverWorks with warm, expressive visuals and stirring theme music — the opening by Tatsuya Kitani
        and the ending by Reira Ushio have already been praised.

        Critics say it’s not your typical “will‑they/won’t they” rom‑com: the tone is gentler, more grounded, and
        emphasises personal growth and breaking down social barriers rather than over‑the‑top drama.
        India Today <br>
        Why it’s capturing hearts

        Social commentary is woven lightly into the story: the two schools symbolise different worlds, and the
        characters’ developing friendship highlights empathy, understanding, and the courage to challenge assumptions.
        Viewers on forums are calling it “a breath of fresh air” among romance anime.</p>
