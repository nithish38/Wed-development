       <p>
        🩸 Muzan Kibutsuji (鬼舞辻無惨)

Role: Main antagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba
Species: Demon (formerly Human)
Gender: Male
Affiliation: Leader of all demons
Creator: Koyoharu Gotouge <br>
⚔️ Background

Muzan Kibutsuji is the first demon and the source of all demons in the world of Demon Slayer. Over a thousand years ago, he was a sickly human who underwent an experimental treatment to cure his terminal illness. The treatment backfired, transforming him into an immortal being — the first demon.

From then on, Muzan began creating more demons by infusing his blood into humans, seeking to build an army and find a way to conquer his only weakness: sunlight. <br>

😈 Personality 

Muzan is:

Ruthless and narcissistic — sees himself as a perfect being and shows no empathy for others.

Paranoid — constantly afraid of death, particularly from sunlight or those who might destroy him.

Manipulative and cruel — treats his subordinates (the Twelve Kizuki) as disposable tools.

Intelligent and cunning — can disguise himself as various humans to hide among society. <br>

💪 Powers and Abilities

Superhuman Strength, Speed, and Regeneration: Far exceeds ordinary demons.

Shape-shifting: Can alter his body and appearance (even his gender and age).

Cell Manipulation: Can control demons created from his blood and kill them remotely if they disobey.

Blood Demon Art: His attacks involve tentacle-like whips and the ability to manipulate flesh.

Creation of Demons: By sharing his blood, he can turn humans into demons — though few survive.

Near-Immortality: Cannot die from aging or normal wounds. <br>

🌞 Goal

Muzan’s primary goal throughout the series is to conquer sunlight, which is the only thing that can kill him. To achieve this, he seeks the Blue Spider Lily, a mythical flower tied to his transformation, and later targets Nezuko Kamado, who can survive sunlight. <br>

⚰️ Fate (Spoiler Alert)

In the final arc of Demon Slayer, Muzan is ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of the Demon Slayer Corps. Despite his immense power and regeneration, he is unable to withstand the sunlight once dawn breaks. Before dying, he attempts to pass on his will to Tanjiro, trying to turn him into a “perfect demon,” but fails. <br>

    ⚔️ Yoriichi Tsugikuni — Overview

Japanese Name: 継国 縁壱 (Tsugikuni Yoriichi)

Affiliation: Demon Slayer Corps (former)

Era: Sengoku Period (over 400 years before the main story)

Occupation: Demon Slayer

Family: Michikatsu Tsugikuni (older twin brother, who later becomes Kokushibo) <br>

🌅 Who Is Yoriichi?

Yoriichi Tsugikuni is the legendary Demon Slayer who first created the Breath Styles and was the original user of the Sun Breathing (Hinokami Kagura) — the strongest and purest breathing technique.

He is the one who nearly killed Muzan Kibutsuji, the first demon and main antagonist of Demon Slayer. Even though Yoriichi couldn’t finish him off, he was the only human Muzan ever truly feared. <br>

🔥 Abilities and Powers
🌞 1. Sun Breathing (Hinokami Kagura)

The very first and most powerful Breathing Style, from which all other Breathing Styles (like Water, Flame, Wind, etc.) were derived.

Yoriichi could perform all 12 forms fluidly, even creating seamless new combinations mid-battle.

It allowed him to move with superhuman precision and strike demons’ weak points perfectly. <br>

👁️ 2. Transparent World

A heightened state of perception where Yoriichi could see the internal organs and muscle movements of his opponents, predicting their every move.

He achieved this naturally, without training — a sign of his genius. <br>

💪 3. Godlike Physical Abilities

Even as a child, he displayed incredible speed, strength, and reflexes that far surpassed normal humans.

He could defeat demons effortlessly, even before joining the Demon Slayer Corps. <br>

🧘 4. Fighting Spirit & Focus

Despite his immense power, Yoriichi was humble and kind-hearted, never arrogant.

He lived a tragic life, marked by loneliness and loss, yet remained pure in spirit. <br>

😔 Personality

Yoriichi is calm, gentle, and deeply empathetic — in contrast to his brother, Michikatsu.
He valued life and sought peace, but his extraordinary strength isolated him from others.
He never hated his brother, even after Michikatsu became the demon Kokushibo. <br>

⚰️ Legacy

Yoriichi’s earrings (Hanafuda earrings) were passed down to Tanjiro Kamado’s family.

The Sun Breathing was preserved through Tanjiro’s Hinokami Kagura, a dance passed down for generations.

His memory and skills continued to shape the Demon Slayer Corps centuries after his death. <br>

💥 Notable Feat

Yoriichi once fought Muzan and nearly killed him single-handedly — slicing him into over 1,500 pieces in the blink of an eye. Muzan barely escaped by dispersing himself, and the fear of Yoriichi haunted him for centuries. <br>

    ⚔️ The Combatants
Yoriichi Tsugikuni

The first and strongest Demon Slayer in history.

Invented Breath of the Sun (the original breathing style).

Born with the Demon Slayer Mark, Transparent World, and Red Nichirin Blade — essentially a perfect demon-killing package.

Calm, compassionate, and utterly terrifying in battle.

Muzan Kibutsuji

The first demon, and the progenitor of all others.

Possesses near-limitless regeneration, multiple hearts and brains, and the ability to shapeshift.

Arrogant and cunning — he believes himself immortal. <br>

⚡ The Battle (As Shown in the Manga)

When they finally faced each other centuries before Tanjiro’s era, Yoriichi completely overwhelmed Muzan.

Yoriichi activated Transparent World, reading Muzan’s movements and internal organs in perfect detail.

With just a few swings, he cut Muzan into over 1500 pieces in an instant — so fast Muzan didn’t even realize it until it was too late.

Muzan barely survived by dispersing his body into tiny pieces and escaping, though many of those fragments were destroyed by sunlight.

Yoriichi, despite his strength, failed to finish him because he was simply too kind and too late to stop every piece. <br>

🔥 Aftermath

Muzan was traumatized. He never forgot the terror of facing Yoriichi and feared the Sun Breathing users for centuries.

Every time he saw a user of the Hinokami Kagura (Sun Breathing’s descendant), he was reminded of that defeat.

Yoriichi was later expelled from the Corps for breaking a rule but continued fighting demons until his peaceful death — still undefeated. <br>

🩸 Verdict
Category	Winner
Raw Power	Yoriichi
Regeneration & Immortality	Muzan
Skill & Technique	Yoriichi
Overall Fight Outcome	Yoriichi dominates, Muzan narrowly escapes <br>

In simple terms:
➡️ Yoriichi didn’t just win — he traumatized Muzan for eternity.
